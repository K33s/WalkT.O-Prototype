Team Members: Shanil Patel, Andy Le, Winnie Winnie, Raship Trikha and Keenan Dsouza;
Program: WalkTO Prototype;
Date Created: 22/09/2018;
Description: WalkT.O is a platform aimed towards making the streets of Toronto safer and more accessible to the community while collecting more meaningful data. WalkT.O offers safe walking services to people, on demand during any time of the day. The user connects to a designated safe walk employee through the WalkT.O app who then accompanies them to the destination through streets that user finds unsafe. The user then leaves feedback on why they felt unsafe which helps collect data that can be used to create a more data connected, healthy and happier city. Thus laying a foundation to a smart city.
