Description: WalkTO app is a platform aimed towards making the streets of toronto safer and more accessible to the community. WalkTO offers safe walk services to people, on demand at any time of the day. The user connects to a designated safe walk employee through the WalkTO app who then accompanies them to the destination through streets that user deems unsafe. The user then leaves feedback on why they felt  unsafe which helps collect data that in turn can be used to fix similar problems in the future.
